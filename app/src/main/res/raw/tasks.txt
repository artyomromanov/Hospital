Tell me about yourself:

Hi, my name is Artyom, I am a Senior Android Developer and Software Engineer.

I have 4+ years of Android development experience and more than 10 years hands on coding experience.

Born in a family of programmers(mum and dad) I was always surrounded with all kinds of computer logic.

I have touched different IT fields, however looking at MobileDevelopment I have chosen it for being the most

rewarding and challenging - I am a person who is afraid of slow and mundane environment, and embrace new 

challenges and new things to implemement.


Last 4 years I was working on different android projects, working with teams of different sizes, and exposed to 

different problems as well.


For instance, in my last project, I was dealing with features like Work Manager, in order to support file download without hindering User Experience, change certificate pinning implementation, so reasonably small tickets; and back-end was very helpful and professional.

The app was English Test from Englich Council


On the one before that, the HiyaCar app for Car Rental, we worked in a Team of ,and there was a bit of everything, literally lots of work with the back-end collecting crash data, lots of error handling, testing testing and testing. 

There was custom Map to be added to show where is the closest car available

There was security work, where we put SQL Cipher, to secure the transactions better, and AuthTokenInterceptor

to be added, and Android Keystore to add an extra layer of security

There was asynch data stream processing to implement which we user Reactive Streams library, and there was lots of data to process seamlessly,

And the other developers were busy with other apps project owner had at the same time, so it was often me and a junior or two vs the back end and time.

Worked on it in total for over a year, which was very enriching experience.

To conclude

I am type of person who likes to solve problems, test and move on. I like constructive dialog and productive Scrum meeting, but I don't like philosophers

who will hide their incompetence behind long discussions on How To? If I dont know - I say I dont know and I go and research, which is a better use of time in 
my opinion. Quick learner so no problem for me to do that, and I am always in favour of a creative approach too.
